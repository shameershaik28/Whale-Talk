Whale Talk
Transform a phrase like "turpentine and turtles" into its “whale talk” equivalent: "UUEEIEEAUUEE".

Translation Rules
No Consonants: Only vowels are used, excluding “y”.
Double 'U' and 'E': The vowels 'u' and 'e' are extended, so they must be doubled in the output.
Slow and Melodic: The final translation is sung slowly, as is customary in whale communication.
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use loops to convert standard text into whale language by following the rules above.
